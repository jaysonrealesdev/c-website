                Aware of the development needs of the country. particularly of the Bicol Region in the areas of science and technology, <b>Mr. Reynaldo A. Belleza</b>, <i>Certified Public Accountant (CPA)</i> and a <i>Bank Manager</i>  then, had decided to step up his help where it was needed most-the training of manpower that presents the fruits of the recent research in computer and technological education. The founder of this institution had the vision of molding the youth through quality education into graduates who will be productive members of our society in various areas of endeavor. That vision has been made a reality when CAT College was founded on <time>June 10, 1987</time> and formally accredited by the Department of Education Culture and Sports (DECS) in 1989.
            </p>

                The school had its humble beginnings. It started with only 4-rented rooms at the second floor of PVLB Building in downtown Legazpi, with only 120 students and a handful instructors and administrative staff. A year after, enrollment increased to 198. Additional rooms were provided at the 2nd floor of King's Commercial Center situated just across the PVLB Building. Then in 1991, the school had 282 enrollees which necessitated a bigger and permanent space. A new school site located at Balintawak Street, Albay District, Legazpi City was found available to accommodate the total enrollment of 402 students.

                Imbued with prime interest in youth development, the management of CAT College expanded its operation. In 1989, CAT College management ac- quired Southern Luzon Technical School in Kimantong, Daraga, Albay. It was heavily devastated by super typhoon Sisang. Before, this school offered only vocational courses. Upon the acquisition of the Belleza's it offered a 4-year course, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS). It's pioneer students graduated in March 1993. The school has been renamed as Southern Luzon Technological College (SOLZTEC). Then in 1996, SOLZTEC has been merged with CAT College as its component department.

                During the school year 1993-1994, Albay Institute of Technology (AIT), the sister school of CAT College was opened in Sta. Cruz, Ligao Albay. Its existence serves the noble purpose of providing affordable education to the youth of Ligao City and its adjoining municipalities toward national development.

            <p>
                Across the years, CAT College has metamorphosed dramatically into a prestigious institution of higher education. It has been responding to the needs of the times through its relevant course offerings.
